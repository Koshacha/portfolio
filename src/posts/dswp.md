Quite an interesting project I've been working on. Using React.js, I created a website that allows users to exchange cryptocurrency. The interface was created using Tailwind CSS, and communication with the backend is mostly done using Socket.io messaging. Also, the project has a pretty simple internationalization. In this project I only worked on Frontend and a little bit on DevOps.

## Choosing a React.js

The site is quite simple, globally it consists of a cryptocurrency exchange component and minimalistic content pages, so I chose React.js. I also decided to use TypeScript in this project to simplify the work of future developers and protect the client from unexpected errors.

## Work Progress

The project was finished quite quickly, during the work I mastered working with Socket.io, strengthened my knowledge about dockerization of projects and about routing in React.js. Most importantly, I got to know Vite.

## Interesting realization details

I decided to fully type Socket.io inbound and outbound, but as it turns out, there isn't much information about this in the official documentation.

Incoming messages:

- _ticker_ - contains either exchange rate data or current order data
- _order_ - contains data about created, requested order.

And here are the outgoing messages. They are more complicated, because from the backend side all these messages were received with a single identifier "order".

- _currencies_ - request currency data.
- _order_data_ - request order data.
- _change_ - create a request for currency exchange
- _rate_ - evaluate the work of the service, whether the order was fulfilled (or not).

I wrote the following code, which completely covered my needs in this typing and works just perfectly.

```ts
interface ServerToClientEvents {
  ticker: (message: SocketCurrenciesMessage | SocketExchangeRateMessage) => void;
  order: (res: OrderResponse) => void;
}

export interface ClientSocket extends Socket<ServerToClientEvents> {
  emit(event: 'order', type: 'currencies'): this;
  emit(event: 'order', type: 'order_data', dto: GetOrderDto): this;
  emit(event: 'order', type: 'change', dto: CreateOrderDto): this;
  emit(event: 'order', type: 'rate', dto: OrderRateDto): this;
}
```
